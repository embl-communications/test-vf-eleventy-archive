// **Thinking about deleting this file?**
// If your component needs no CSS/Sass, we still recommend leaving the
// scss files in place. As this is primarily a CSS framework, it is better to
// leave the empty files so you know a file wasn't accidently omitted.
// If you don't have any Sass, you can trim this block down to:
// "This page was intentionally left blank"


@import 'vf-local-overrides.variables.scss';

.vf-content img {
  /* this is likely something we should add to vf-core, we haven't done much image testing yet */
  max-width: 100%;
